# TODO

- when requesting a page/component, adding `.html` to the end will serve a page that beautifies the rendered ejs
- make paths (for include and script tags) more intuitive
  - pages should use index.js, should use page name for files
- make `preview.ejs` to establish shell for component previews
  - placeholder in body for injecting component's `_preview.ejs`
  - auto-add script tag for component's `_preview.js`
